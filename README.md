# CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE - AWS

## Introduction

The [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a hands-on project designed to showcase cloud skills by building and deploying a resume using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP. It involves frontend hosting, backend integration, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and security best practices, demonstrating proficiency in modern cloud technologies.

## Architecture

The project consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: A static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on Amazon S3 and served via Amazon CloudFront.
- **Backend**: A serverless API implemented using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda (Python), and AWS DynamoDB to track visitor count.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions to deploy the Frontend and Backend code to the S3 for the static website and the lambda function respectively.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provisioned using Terraform for repeatability and automation.

## Project Status

| Component   | Status          | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Completed âœ… | S3, CloudFront configured, ok script for download frontend code, missing domain configuration on route53, integration with ACM |
| **Backend**  | Completed âœ… | API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM roles, and monitoring implemented, also implemented JS on frontend |
| **CI/CD**    | Completed âœ… | Github actions deploy the code from frontend and backend repository to the respective targets, all configurations, users and permissions on AWS and secrets and vars in Github, are configured with terraform |
| **Improvements**    | Planned ðŸ”œ      | Subdomain configurations to free the root domain, domain for api gw, logic to not update the counter on page reload, testing units, cloudwatch logging, other improvements |
| **Refactoring**    | Planned ðŸ”œ      | Refactoring the terraform code to a better structure using modules to use them in day job |

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- Domain registered on Route53
- 3 GitHub repositories: one for IaC, one for Frontend, one for Backend

### Deploy

Specify your .tfvars file when you deploy your infrastructure
- Verify your configuration: `terraform validate`
- Set your environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- Configure your local variables using terraform.tfvars files (I have prepared a .tfvars.template you can use)
- Plan your deployment: `terraform plan --file-var=terraform.tfvars`
- Execute and create: `terraform apply --file-var=terraform.tfvars`
- Commit your frontend and backend repository to deploy them

DO NOT COMMIT YOUR .tfvars FILES OR YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES! 

### Notes

To destroy the infrastructure you should first manually disable and delete the CloudFront deployment.
Then run `terraform destroy`
