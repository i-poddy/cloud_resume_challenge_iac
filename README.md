# CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE - AWS

## Introduction

The [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) is a hands-on project designed to showcase cloud skills by building and deploying a resume using cloud services like AWS, Azure, or GCP. It involves frontend hosting, backend integration, infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and security best practices, demonstrating proficiency in modern cloud technologies.

## Architecture

The project consists of the following components:

- **Frontend**: A static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosted on Amazon S3 and served via Amazon CloudFront.
- **Backend**: A serverless API implemented using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda (Python), and AWS DynamoDB to track visitor count.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Provisioned using Terraform for repeatability and automation.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline automating deployments for both frontend and backend.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch for logs and error tracking.

## Project Status

| Component   | Status          | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| **Frontend** | Completed ‚úÖ | S3, CloudFront configured, ok script for download frontend code, missing domain configuration on route53, integration with ACM |
| **Backend**  | Work in Progress üõ†Ô∏è      | API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM roles, and monitoring implemented, also implemented JS on frontend, optimizing and waiting to apply changes |
| **CI/CD**    | Work in Progress üõ†Ô∏è      | AWS CodePipeline with CodeBuild and CodeDeploy to create a pipeline for frontend and a pipeline for backend |
| **Improvements**    | Planned üîú      | Add versioning to S3, better logging, subdomain configurations to free the root domain |
| **Refactoring**    | Planned üîú      | Refactoring the terraform code to a better structure using modules to use them in day job |

## Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed
- Domain registered on Route53
- 3 GitHub repositories: one for IaC, one for Frontend, one for Backend

### Deploy

Specify your .tfvars file when you deploy your infrastructure
- Verify your configuration: `terraform validate`
- Configure your environment variables
- Configure your local variables using terraform.tfvars files
- Plan your deployment: `terraform plan --file-var=terraform.tfvars`
- Execute and create: `terraform apply --file-var=terraform.tfvars`

DO NOT COMMIT YOUR .tfvars FILES OR YOUR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES! 

### Notes

To destroy the infrastructure you should first manually disable and delete the CloudFront deployment.
Then run `terraform destroy`
